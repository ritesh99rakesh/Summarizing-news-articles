# Summarizing-news-articles
As the project name suggests our aim is to teach computer enough so that it can give summary of the lengthy news articles or as a matter of fact any articles (given proper data set to train and required processing units).
So basically we are using various concepts of machine learning and deep learning to train our model for generating summary of a given article.
In our case we have used ‘reuters’ corpus from NLTK as training dataset and tensorflow module for training the model.
